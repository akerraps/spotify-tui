# Spotify Playlist TUI (Learning Project)

This is a personal project I’m building to learn Go.
The goal is to create a terminal-based user interface (TUI) that lets you manage your Spotify playlists using the Spotify Web API.

It’s not meant to be production-ready or bug-free. In fact, it’s very likely to have broken code, bad design choices, and random experiments — because that’s the point. I’m figuring things out as I go, and this repo is basically my sandbox.

# Current status

Right now, there’s not much here. The plan is to:

- Connect to the Spotify API.
- List and browse playlists.
- Downloas playlists to CSV.
- Eventually make it somewhat usable.

# Disclaimer

This is a learning project. Expect:

- Messy commits.
- Features that appear and disappear without warning.
- Bugs I probably won’t notice until later.

If you’re looking for a stable tool, this isn’t it. If you want to follow along as I learn Go and mess with the Spotify API, you’re welcome to.
